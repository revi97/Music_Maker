# Music_Maker
 
Built with the help of HTML, CSS and Vanilla JAVASCRIPT to make pre-alloted sounds when you click on the boxes which are the bottom of the page.
It even has a some CSS animation in it so that when clicked it would look cool as far as the visuals go. 

The sounds in this project which all have I used has been taken from freesound.org for the purpose of the project.
